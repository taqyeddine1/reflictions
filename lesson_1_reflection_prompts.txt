    In the manual save process you will be able to save when you see it is important
	to save a search does not save a lot of copies and a few of them, but be able to save
	the most appropriate code unlike automatic saving.

    Git uses the simultaneous save feature for all files in this folder because 
	these files may have relationships with some others.

	but the GIT command is a guest that compares the arguments.
